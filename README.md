## 🏆 Notable Projects

### 🚨 Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Pipeline
A GPU-accelerated microservices pipeline for real-time content moderation on professional platforms.  

**Processes JSON inputs** (e.g., `"Ami kal party te jabo"`) with:
- **Translation**: `easynmt` (m2m_100_418M) for non-English to English
- **Hate Speech Detection**: Ensemble (fasttext, MuRIL, IndicBERT, XLMR, DistilBERT) with rule-based boosts; flags >0.7 scores
- **Tagging**: `intfloat/e5-large-v2` embeddings for personalized curation

**Tech**: Docker, PyTorch 2.1.2, AWS EC2 `g4dn.xlarge` (NVIDIA T4, CUDA 12.8), Nginx proxy  
**Impact**: Sub-0.8s inference, fault-tolerant with backup models, logs to `flagged_hate_speech.jsonl` for retraining  
**Privacy**: Self-hosted to bypass external APIs like GPT, ensuring data security
